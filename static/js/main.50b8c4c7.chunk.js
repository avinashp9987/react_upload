It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and semolina dough, cooked in light sugar syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings. The earliest evidence of rasagola can be found in the epic poem Dandi Ramayana which was composed by famous Odia poet Balarama Dasa in which he mentioned that Rasagola is offered to Maa Laxmi by Lord Jagannath in a ritual called Niladri Bije. In 2017, when West Bengal got its Rosogolla's Geographical indication status, the Registry office of India clarified that West Bengal was given GI status for Banglar Rosogolla and Odisha can claim it too if they cite the place of origin of their variant along with colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing."},{Id:"37",Category:"food",Date:" August 9, 2021 ",Name:"Biryani",Img:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BCKMeHuRX0I/maxresdefault.jpg",Details:"Origin place - India",About:"Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, as well as among the diaspora from the region. It has gained popularity in South India, and is also prepared in other parts of the world such as Iraqi Kurdistan.[7] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services. There are many types of biryani, whose names are often based on their region of origin. For example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, and Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India. Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it, for example: Haji Biriyani, Haji Nanna Biriyani in Old Dhaka,[31] Fakhruddin Biriyani in Dhaka,[32][33] Students biryani in Karachi, Lucky biryani in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi biryani in Colaba, Mumbai.[24] Biryanis are often specific to the Muslim communities where they originate; they are usually the defining dishes of those communities. Beef biryani, as the name implies, uses beef as the meat. In Hyderabad, it is famous as Kalyani biryani, in which buffalo or cow meat is used.[36][37] This meal was started after the Kalyani Nawabs of Bidar came to Hyderabad sometime in the 18th century. The Kalyani biryani is made with small cubes of beef, regular spices, onions and many tomatoes. It has a distinct tomato, jeera and dhania flavor.[38] In Kerala, beef biryani is well known.[39] The Bhatkali biryani is a special variant where the main ingredient is onion. Its variations include beef, goat, chicken, titar, egg, fish, crab, prawn and vegetable biryani."},{Id:"38",Category:"food",Date:" August 9, 2021 ",Name:"Pav bhaji",Img:"https://www.cubesnjuliennes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Instant-Pot-Mumbai-Pav-Bhaji-Recipe.jpg",Details:" Origin - south india",About:" Pav bhaji is a spiced mixture of mashed vegetables in a thick gravy served with bread.
